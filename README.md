Projects Based on Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart

Projects:
1. phoneAndEmail: 
    - Program that takes data copied on clipboard and returns all phone numbers
    and email addresses found
    -Examples of projects that I could do with the same technology:
        - Find website URLs that begin with http:// or https://.
        - Clean up dates in different date formats (such as 3/14/2015, 03-14-2015, 
        and 2015/3/14) by replacing them with dates in a single, standard format.
        - Remove sensitive information such as Social Security or credit card numbers.
        - Find common typos such as multiple spaces between words, 
        accidentally accidentally repeated words, or multiple 
        exclamation marks at the end of sentences. Those are annoying!!
        - Strong password detection: Write a function that uses regular 
        expressions to make sure the password string it is passed is strong. 
        A strong password is defined as one that is at least eight characters 
        long, contains both uppercase and lowercase characters, and has at least 
        one digit. 
        - Regex Version of STRIP(): Write a function that takes a string and does 
        the same thing as the strip() string method. If no other arguments are passed 
        other than the string to strip, then whitespace characters will be removed 
        from the beginning and end of the string. Otherwise, the characters specified 
        in the second argument to the function will be removed from the string.
